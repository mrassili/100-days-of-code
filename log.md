# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Got to know SASS and HTML5 Canvas and used them on my #freeCodeCamp Project "Random Quote Machine" (Design almost complete!)

**Today's Progress**: Did the final touches to my Random Quote Machine design, will then establish a media query for mobile view.
